👋 My name is **Gaurang Sandeep Deshpande**, and I have recently completed a diploma in Computer Science. I am a geek with a deep fascination for coding, artificial intelligence, cars, and, most importantly, space and astrophysics. In addition to my passion for these fields, I possess a solid understanding of PCs and can build one from scratch if needed. While most people are full-stack developers specializing in front-end and back-end development, I consider myself a unique kind of full-stack enthusiast. I excel not only in software but also in hardware, seamlessly integrating both aspects to create comprehensive and efficient technological solutions.
